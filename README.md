# TriviaMakerAppPython
This app comes with two files:  triviaMaker.py and triviaApp.py

THe trivia maker app is used to create a csv in the app folder of multiple choice questions where the first column is the question, followed by 4 columns of possible answers, and a 5th column that contains the letter o the correct answer.

The triviaApp.py reads the csv file in a way that displays the question and 4 possible solutions and then checks your answer against the 6th column containing the correct answer. 
It would be nice to add extra functionality into the app where it randomizes the rows on the CSV before starting the quiz.  I plan on adding that into version 1.02
triviaApp.py keeps a running tally of how many questions were asked and how many have been answered correctly.  If more than 70% have been answered correctly at the end of the program, ascii art pops up with a "Pass" message.  

Usage:  I created this app to study for the compTIA A+ certification.  I have created a comptia folder on my computer, and create possible test questions on it using the maker app.  As I create more questions, the CSV file grows and grows.  If the CSV grows above a level that can comfortably be done in a single sitting, I move the file to its own sub directory and begin a new one. Using this method, I have created multiple practice tests for my exam.  
I have also began using it for other things I am studying.  For each subject, I copy both .py files into their own folder and begin creating practice tests for that subject.  

If there is any questions about this app, or ideas on how to improve it, please message me.  This is my first real github push, so I would love to hear from the community about it!
